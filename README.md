## Reverse an Array
### Challenge
write a method to reverse an array

### Approach & Efficiency
My partner and I took the nested for-loop approach. I belive there is probably a more efficent method, but we went this way because we know it would work

### Solution

## Shift an Array
### Challenge
write a method to add an elment into an array of integers

### Approach & Efficiency
My partner and I took the approach of dividing the array by length to determine the middle and insert the new element

## Binary Search an Array
### Challenge
write a method to binary search an array

### Approach & Efficiency
My partner and I took the approach of dividing the array by its length and repeating until the the search number was found

## Insert Node at Kth
### Challenge
write a method to insert a node in the "kth" position from the end of a linked list

#Code Challenge 15
## Tree and Binary Search Tree

### Challenge
Create a class `Tree` which has `preOrder()`, `inOrder()`, and `postOrder()` traversal methods.

Create a class `BinarySearchTree` which has `add(int value)` and `contains(int value)` methods.
